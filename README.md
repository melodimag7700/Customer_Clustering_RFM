# 📝 Project Description 

This  repository explores how to perform RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on transaction data to segment customers for targeted marketing strategies. Using pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, it calculates RFM metrics per customer, assigns them to behavioral clusters (New, Inactive, Fixed), and visualizes the customer segments with a bar chart.


# 🔍  Purpose:

The main goal is to show how businesses can use purchase history data to:

Identify new, inactive, and loyal customers.
Understand customer value and engagement based on shopping patterns.
Create actionable segments for more effective marketing and retention campaigns.

# 📊  How it works:


Loads transaction data from an Excel file.
Processes and cleans the data.
Calculates RFM metrics for each customer.
Segments customers based on RFM quantiles.
Visualizes segment distribution for business insights.
